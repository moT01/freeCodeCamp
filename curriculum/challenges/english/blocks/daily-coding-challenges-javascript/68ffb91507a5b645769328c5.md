# --description--

Given a sentence string, return the longest word in the sentence.

- Words are separated by a single space.
- Only letters (`a-z`, case-insensitive) count toward the word's length.
- If there are multiple words with the same length, return the first one that appears.
- Return the word as it appears in the given string, with punctuation removed.

# --hints--

`longestWord("The quick red fox")` should return `"quick"`.

```js
assert.equal(longestWord("The quick red fox"), "quick");
```

`longestWord("Hello coding challenge.")` should return `"challenge"`.

```js
assert.equal(longestWord("Hello coding challenge."), "challenge");
```

`longestWord("Do Try This At Home.")` should return `"This"`.

```js
assert.equal(longestWord("Do Try This At Home."), "This");
```

`longestWord("This sentence... has commas, ellipses, and an exlamation point!")` should return `"exlamation"`.

```js
assert.equal(longestWord("This sentence... has commas, ellipses, and an exlamation point!"), "exlamation");
```

`longestWord("A tie? No way!")` should return `"tie"`.

```js
assert.equal(longestWord("A tie? No way!"), "tie");
```

# --solutions--

```js
function longestWord(sentence) {
  const words = sentence.split(" ");
  let longest = "";

  for (let word of words) {
    const cleaned = word.replace(/[^a-z]/gi, "");
    if (cleaned.length > longest.length) {
      longest = cleaned;
    }
  }

  return longest;
}
```
